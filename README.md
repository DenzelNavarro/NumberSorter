# Number Sorter

This project is a **Number Sorter** where users can input a set of numbers and sort them using different sorting algorithms. It visually demonstrates how sorting works through JavaScript.

## Features

- Input a list of numbers.
- Sort the numbers using **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, or **Insertion Sort**.
- Simple and interactive interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the webpage structure.
- **CSS** for styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript** for implementing sorting algorithms and DOM manipulation.

## Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire array is sorted.
2. **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Picks elements one by one and inserts them into their correct position within a sorted portion of the array.

## How to Use

1. Enter numbers into the input fields.
2. Click the "Sort" button to sort the numbers.
3. The sorted numbers will be displayed in the output area.

## What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to:
- Implement and visualize sorting algorithms in JavaScript.
- Use DOM manipulation to update the UI dynamically.
- Handle events with JavaScript for user interaction.
